## Intro:
This is a **Simple Web App** called  **Standard Calculator**. This **HTML** source code was developed using **HTML, CSS, and Javascript (jQuery)**. I know that everyone knows how the calculator works and I'll just explain the other features of this simple **HTML Project**. The calculator app is able to save the calculation history and this feature uses the web browser's local storage which is means that there are no database servers required to run this project. I am sharing the source code to help others especially those who are students that about to start learning to develop an application. You can also simply integrate this feature into your website that needs a calculator feature. The calculator panel is located at the bottom right of the browser's window like the common chatbox panel of a website.
